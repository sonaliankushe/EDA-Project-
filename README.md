What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVE OF THE CHASE
Vacations, business stay or a casual trip to a new city, hotel bookings are mandatory and each one of us desires to optimize our stay. Optimization, for someone could be booking a hotel where he/she pays less for a good deal, or maybe just getting the only luxurious suite, in a 7-star hotel during a non-peak period.

We are given a Hotel Booking dataset, which stores tabular information about the guests' booking pattern, stay duration, choice of meal and much more for a consecutive year range and we’ll be performing a profound analysis on the dataset, to dig out details and predict a few trends pertaining to the data. Firstly, I don't want to pay any surged random price for my booking rather, I will be happy to pay an optimized value for my stay. Secondly, I want my vacation to be safe, as I am accompanying my loved ones, so I would prefer a hotel with less crowd and well equipped with health and safety measures.

Our analysis, would be capable of helping prospective guests in choosing the right hotel, right stay duration and much more for their stay and moreover, would also be introspecting for hotel management in bringing out changes (if, any) in their services for the guests.

Let's begin the chase!
